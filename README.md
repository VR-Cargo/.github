# VR-Cargo Organization Templates

This repository contains organization-wide GitHub configuration and templates for all VR-Cargo repositories.

## Issue Templates

Templates automatically available in all VR-Cargo repositories:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml) | Request new features with priority and acceptance criteria |
| [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml) | Report bugs with severity, reproduction steps, and environment |

## How It Works

GitHub automatically applies these templates to any repository in the VR-Cargo organization that doesn't have its own templates.
